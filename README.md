# Solstage

Welcome to Solstage, a platform to manage and display your NFT collections.

----------

## The Problem

You want to show your cool NFTs in your wallet. But your wallet is jammed by many Ads NFTs & SCAM NFTs.

----------

## Our Solution is Simple

- We provide you the "Stage", "Backstage" and "Junkbox" filtering categories to your NFTs.
- You pin what you like in "Stage" and you put normal NFTs in "Backstage".
- By default, NFTs goes into Junkbox.
- Anyone can view anyone's profile, to visit their "Stage" Trophy Room.

----------

## The Categories

## STAGE - The One place to show off your NFTs

- You select what NFTs to show on the `STAGE`! It's your trophy room!

## BACKSTAGE

- A place to put your normal NFTs. You select what to put here. And popular NFTs will auto fall in here (TODO in the future).

## JUNKBOX

- By default all NFTs will fall in `JUNKBOX`. Say Goodbye to spamming NFTs flooding in your wallet's.

----------

## Done
- UI to display wallet NFTs profile.
- Ability to categorizing NFTs into Stage, Backstage, Junkbox.

## TODO
- Polish Stage UI to be more attractive.
- Improve UI to be make UX smooth.

## Long term TODO
- Provide some interaction between users. It could be something like users may "likes" anyone's Stage profile when they visit.
- Introduce "Gift" category. It may let people sending NFT to the others as "Gift" which reserved some SOL on it. Received user can claim the "Gift".
- Provide an open standard for NFT pinning (Like the stage). So Wallet Apps, DApps can make use of our filter for better display UX to the user.
